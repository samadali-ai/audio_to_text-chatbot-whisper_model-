# Multimodal AI System: Image & Audio Interaction

## Overview

This project is focused on building a multimodal AI system that allows users to interact with images using audio input. The system is designed to take an image and an audio question as input, process these inputs to understand the context, and provide a response in both text and audio formats. It leverages state-of-the-art models for audio recognition and image analysis, making it possible to seamlessly integrate voice and visual data for enhanced user interaction.

## Features

- **Audio Transcription:** The system uses the Whisper model to transcribe spoken questions into text. This transcription is the first step in understanding what the user wants to know about the image.
  
- **Image Analysis:** A vision model such as CLIP or LLaVA is employed to analyze the image provided by the user. The model extracts relevant features and understands the content of the image, which is crucial for answering the user's question accurately.

- **Question Interpretation and Answering:** Once the system has the transcribed question and the analyzed image, it interprets the question in the context of the image. The system then generates a text-based answer, which is relevant to the visual content.

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** The answer is not only provided in text format but is also converted into speech using a text-to-speech engine. This dual output enhances accessibility and provides a more interactive user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Whisper Model:** For transcribing audio input into text.
- **Vision Models:** Such as CLIP or LLaVA, for analyzing images and extracting visual features.
- **Text-to-Speech Engine:** Converts the text-based answers into audio, allowing the system to communicate the response verbally.
- **Backend Framework:** The application logic, including processing of inputs and generation of outputs, is handled by a backend framework like FastAPI.
- **Frontend Framework:** A user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit, which allows users to easily upload images, record questions, and receive answers.

## Installation and Setup

To set up this project, you would typically begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine. Next, you would create a virtual environment to manage dependencies and then install the necessary libraries and models required for the project. This includes setting up the Whisper model for audio transcription, installing the vision models for image analysis, and configuring a text-to-speech engine for audio output


## Example Workflow

Imagine you upload a photo of a person holding a cup in a park and ask the system, "What is the person holding?" The system would:
1. Use the Whisper model to transcribe your audio question into text.
2. Analyze the image to identify objects and features, focusing on the person and what they are holding.
3. Interpret your question and generate an answer based on the image analysis.
4. Display the text answer, "The person is holding a cup," and also provide this answer in audio format.

## Applications

This system can be applied in various fields:
- **Educational Tools:** It can be used in educational settings to help students ask questions about images, such as historical photographs or scientific diagrams, making learning more interactive.
- **Accessibility:** The system can assist visually impaired users by providing verbal descriptions of images and answering questions about them.
- **Customer Support:** In e-commerce or tech support, users can ask questions about product images, and the system can provide answers, enhancing customer service interactions.
